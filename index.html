            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Sharon Wilfred, and I’m a new EMT excited about emergency medicine. My journey started with a genuine interest in medicine, which grew after shadowing several remarkable doctors and participating in various hospital rotations.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an EMT, I get to provide treatment and support to patients in different emergency scenarios. I earned my certification this past summer after going through a rigorous training program that taught me the latest emergency response techniques. Joining NU EMS at Northeastern has been a great way to sharpen my skills and contribute to our campus community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives when they need it most. Whether it’s providing first aid, performing CPR, or just offering a comforting presence, I’m committed to being there for those in need!
            </p>
