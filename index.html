        <p>Hi! I'm Sharon Wilfred, a new EMT who’s passionate about emergency medicine. My journey into this field started with a fascination for medicine that has been with me for as long as I can remember. I’ve had the privilege of shadowing incredible doctors and participating in several hospital rotations. Each experience deepened my interest and commitment to this vital field.</p>

        <p>Now, as an EMT, I have the opportunity to offer treatment and support to patients in urgent situations. After completing a rigorous training program, I earned my certification this past summer. Joining NU EMS at Northeastern has been a fantastic experience, allowing me to sharpen my skills while contributing to my campus community.</p>

        <p>Every day is a chance to make a real difference in someone’s life. Whether it’s administering first aid, performing CPR, or simply being a comforting presence, I’m dedicated to being there for others when they need it most. Here’s a glimpse of my journey so far:</p>
