                Hi! I’m Sharon Wilfred. My journey into emergency medicine started with a genuine fascination for the medical field. 
                Shadowing various doctors and participating in hospital rotations has helped me see firsthand the impact of quality patient care.

                Now, as a certified EMT, I get to provide care in urgent situations. Completing my training this past summer gave me the essential skills to respond effectively in emergencies. 
                I’ve also joined NU EMS at Northeastern, where I actively apply my training while supporting our campus community.
            </p>

                A pivotal figure in my journey has been Dr. Theodore, a family medicine doctor I had the privilege to shadow. His insightful approach to patient care and expertise in managing various conditions have truly inspired me to pursue this path.
