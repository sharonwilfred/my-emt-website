                Emergency medicine is all about providing immediate care to patients facing urgent health issues. This fast-paced field keeps me on my toes, requiring quick decisions and adaptability. 
                I find it rewarding to help people during critical moments when they need it most.

                My training at AEC Associates, the largest EMS school in Virginia, was a game-changer. It equipped me with the skills I need to excel in real-world scenarios. 
                Working in high-pressure environments has reinforced the value of teamwork and clear communication, which are essential in this field.
